# Examples

Run these commands from the repository root. These examples actually restart failed
connectors/tasks when a reachable Kafka Connect cluster is configured; start against
a non-production cluster first.

## Local binary

```sh
go run ./cmd/kafka-connect-healer \
  --config=examples/application.yaml \
  --connect-clusters=examples/connect-clusters.yaml
```

This expects Kafka Connect at `localhost:8083`. To explore the API without polling:

```sh
go run ./cmd/kafka-connect-healer \
  --config=examples/application.yaml \
  --connect-clusters=examples/empty-clusters.yaml
```

The API listens on all interfaces, not only localhost. The example disables API
authentication; use it only on a trusted development machine/network. Credentials
belong in separate, untracked Secret overlay files, not these examples. See the
[configuration and authentication documentation](../README.md#configuration-api).

## Kubernetes

Edit `kubernetes/connect-clusters.yaml` to use your Kafka Connect Service hostname.
Set the Deployment image to a published Docker Hub tag (the example uses `v0.1.0`,
which must exist before applying). For a private Docker Hub repository, configure
an `imagePullSecret` on the pod before deploying.

```sh
kubectl kustomize examples/kubernetes
kubectl apply -k examples/kubernetes
kubectl rollout status deployment/kafka-connect-healer
kubectl port-forward deployment/kafka-connect-healer 8080:8080
```

Then access `http://localhost:8080`. No Service or Ingress is created. This does not
isolate the pod's unauthenticated API from other pods: use network policy and enable
API Basic Auth via a Secret overlay before sharing access. Basic Auth requires TLS
termination at a trusted proxy/Ingress when requests traverse an untrusted network.
Kafka Connect Basic Auth independently requires `https: true`.

Kustomize generates a hashed ConfigMap name. Applying changes to either configuration
file replaces the pod; one replica and `Recreate` avoid overlapping pollers during
updates. Runtime API changes are not persisted, and backoff history resets on restart.
Resource settings are starting points, not capacity guarantees. No health probe is
included: API reachability alone does not indicate Kafka Connect polling health.
