# Kafka Connect Healer

An open-source project maintained by **Entropic Works, Inc.**, created by [Aaron Augustine](https://github.com/aaaugustine29).

The source repository, issue tracker, and pull requests are hosted at [Entropic-Works/kafka-connect-healer](https://github.com/Entropic-Works/kafka-connect-healer).

Polls the REST APIs of named Kafka Connect clusters and restarts failed connectors. When task restarts are enabled, it also restarts failed tasks whose connector is running. Polling begins after the first interval; the service stops on SIGINT or SIGTERM.

## Run

Requires Go 1.27.2 or later.

Clone the repository first:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Entropic-Works/kafka-connect-healer.git
cd kafka-connect-healer
```

Run with all default values:

```sh
go run ./cmd/kafka-connect-healer
```

For a standalone binary without Docker, see [Build from source](#build-from-source).

The Go module path is `github.com/Entropic-Works/kafka-connect-healer`. Application packages remain under `internal/`; this project is a service, not a public Go library.

Supply optional application settings and cluster definitions using separate YAML files:

```sh
go run ./cmd/kafka-connect-healer --config=/path/to/application.yaml --connect-clusters=/path/to/connect-clusters.yaml
```

Runnable local and Kubernetes configurations are provided in [examples/](examples/README.md). Omit `--config` to use all application defaults; an application file containing `{}` has the same effect. Omit `--connect-clusters` to poll one cluster named `default` at `http://localhost:8083`. To supply cluster definitions, use a file containing a mapping of cluster names to endpoint settings. A cluster file containing `{}` starts no pollers; it still starts the application API.

Optional Secret overlays are loaded independently:

```sh
go run ./cmd/kafka-connect-healer \
  --config=/path/to/application.yaml \
  --secret-config=/path/to/application-secret.yaml \
  --connect-clusters=/path/to/connect-clusters.yaml \
  --connect-clusters-secret-config=/path/to/connect-clusters-secret.yaml
```

Both base files and each Secret overlay are optional, but any explicitly supplied file is required. No files are discovered automatically. Unreadable or invalid files cause startup to fail before the HTTP server or polling starts; an invalid file does not fall back to defaults. An application Secret overlay can be supplied without a base file and merges onto application defaults.

The HTTP API listens on port 8080 on all interfaces. `GET /` lists the available routes, `GET /config` returns application settings without the API password, and `GET /clusters` returns cluster definitions without passwords. Optional API authentication protects all routes. An API startup or serving failure is logged as an error while polling continues. On SIGINT or SIGTERM, polling requests are canceled and the API has up to five seconds to finish active requests before its connections are closed. API logs include `component=api` and the listening address. Shutdown logs report the grace period, completion duration, and any failure or forced connection closure; the listener stopping is logged separately at DEBUG while active requests may still be finishing.

API connections have a five-second header timeout, a five-second timeout for reading the entire request including its body, a ten-second response-write timeout, and a one-minute idle timeout. All polling, restart, and backoff logs include `connect_cluster` and `endpoint`; action logs also identify the connector and, for task restarts, `task_id`. Startup logs report the configured cluster count and source, and each poller logs its effective settings, changes, and shutdown at INFO. Restart logs report requests as accepted, since an HTTP success response does not prove that the connector or task has finished restarting. Repeated failure detection, backoff skips, and poll-cycle counts and durations are logged at DEBUG; request attempts are logged at INFO and failures at ERROR. Authentication credentials are omitted. Normal shutdown cancellation does not generate polling failure logs.

## Build from source

Docker and the published image are optional. You can review the source, build it
with your organization's approved Go toolchain, and run the binary directly or
package it in your own internal image.

Clone the repository as shown above and check out the release tag or commit you
have reviewed. Use Go 1.27.2 or later, as required by `go.mod`. For consistent builds,
use the same Go version across your build machines.

Build for the current machine (commands below use a POSIX shell):

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOTOOLCHAIN=local GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off \
  go build -mod=vendor -trimpath -o bin/kafka-connect-healer ./cmd/kafka-connect-healer
```

Dependencies are included in `vendor/`; this command does not download modules or
a Go toolchain. For an offline build, first make the source tree (including `vendor/`)
and the required Go toolchain available in your build environment. No C compiler is
required. `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` makes the build fail if the installed Go version is too
old rather than automatically downloading a newer one.

Run the binary with the example configuration:

```sh
./bin/kafka-connect-healer \
  --config=examples/application.yaml \
  --connect-clusters=examples/connect-clusters.yaml
```

The cluster example points to `localhost:8083`; change it for your environment, or
use `examples/empty-clusters.yaml` to explore the API without polling. The example
disables API authentication, and the API listens on all interfaces. Restrict network
access and configure authentication before exposing it.

To cross-compile a Linux amd64 binary, even from macOS:

```sh
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 GOTOOLCHAIN=local GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off \
  go build -mod=vendor -trimpath -o bin/kafka-connect-healer-linux-amd64 ./cmd/kafka-connect-healer
```

Use `GOARCH=arm64` and a corresponding output filename for Linux arm64. The Linux
binary is statically linked and does not need Go installed at runtime. HTTPS requests
still require trusted CA certificates on the target system; include your organization's
trusted certificates when using an internal image. Run as an unprivileged user and
make configuration files readable by that user. Secret overlay flags work the same
way as when using `go run` or Docker.

For internal redistribution, include `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and applicable third-party
license notices alongside your binary or image. Keep the reviewed source revision
and Go version in your build records. See [Tests](#tests) for pre-deployment checks.

## Docker

Release images are published to `entropicworks/kafka-connect-healer` on Docker Hub
for Linux amd64 and arm64. Use an explicit published version tag, such as `v0.1.0`;
the first tag will only become available after the release workflow completes.

Build the image:

```sh
docker build -t kafka-connect-healer:local .
```

The build uses Go 1.27.2 and vendored dependencies, with networking disabled during compilation. The final `scratch` image contains only the stripped, statically linked binary, public HTTPS CA certificates, and dependency licenses. It runs as non-root UID/GID `65532`, contains no shell or package manager, and supports a read-only root filesystem. Build tools and dependency source code are not included in the runtime image. `.dockerignore` limits the build context to source code and vendored dependencies; configuration files and secrets should be mounted at runtime, not built into the image.

To run with YAML files in an existing local `config` directory:

```sh
docker run --rm --read-only -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  --mount type=bind,src="$PWD/config",dst=/config,readonly \
  kafka-connect-healer:local \
  --config=/config/application.yaml \
  --connect-clusters=/config/connect-clusters.yaml
```

Mounted files must be readable by UID `65532`. Supply Secret overlay flags the same way when needed. Inside the container, `localhost` refers to the container itself; configure a reachable Kafka Connect hostname instead of relying on the default localhost endpoint. For Kubernetes, use the mounted file paths described below.

Build for another architecture with `docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 --load -t kafka-connect-healer:local .`; the Dockerfile cross-compiles for the selected target platform.

## Configuration

Both configuration packages read their own files once at startup, in this order:

1. Application defaults; for clusters, a single `default` cluster when no base file is supplied, or endpoint defaults for each named cluster in a supplied file.
2. Its optional base YAML file, normally mounted from a Kubernetes ConfigMap.
3. Its optional Secret YAML overlay, normally mounted from a Kubernetes Secret.

Application settings live in `internal/config`; cluster configuration lives in `internal/connectcluster`. The files use independent schemas. Application settings remain at the root of the application file, with sections such as `pollingBehavior` and `apiConfig`. The cluster file contains named entries:

```yaml
production:
  host: connect.production.svc
  port: "8083"
  https: true
  authConfig:
    enabled: true
staging:
  host: connect.staging.svc
```

The map key identifies the cluster; there is no separate `name` field. When a cluster base file is supplied, only its entries and those added by its overlay are created. Each new cluster starts with endpoint defaults, so the staging entry above retains port `8083` and disables HTTPS and authentication.

Each supplied field replaces its previous value, including `false` and empty strings. Omitted fields retain their previous values; an empty mapping (`{}`) changes nothing. A supplied nested mapping changes only its supplied fields. Cluster overlays merge each named entry onto that cluster's existing values, preserving its endpoint and omitted credentials. An overlay may add a named cluster or change any field. Without a cluster base file, the overlay merges onto the initial `default` cluster and may add further clusters.

Each merged configuration is validated after its base file and overlay have been loaded, so the base can enable authentication and leave credentials for the overlay. Keep actual credentials outside version control and out of ConfigMaps. A cluster Secret overlay can supply credentials as follows:

```yaml
production:
  authConfig:
    username: replace-me
    password: replace-me
```

Cluster Basic Auth requires `https: true`, a nonblank username without a colon, and a nonempty password. Invalid combinations fail startup; authentication is never silently disabled. All clusters share the application's polling behavior, request timeout, and logging policy, while maintaining independent restart backoff history. Each cluster reuses one HTTP client for status and restart requests; timeout updates apply between polling cycles without replacing that client.

Clusters configured with the same literal endpoint generate a startup warning but remain enabled. The comparison accounts for hostname casing, a trailing DNS dot, equivalent IPv6 spellings, and leading zeros in ports; it does not resolve DNS aliases or discover whether different endpoints belong to the same Kafka Connect cluster. Duplicate pollers maintain separate backoff histories and may issue duplicate restart requests. Warnings never include authentication credentials.

The available settings and defaults are:

| YAML field | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `<cluster>.host` | `localhost` |
| `<cluster>.port` | `"8083"` |
| `<cluster>.https` | `false` |
| `<cluster>.authConfig.enabled` | `false` |
| `<cluster>.authConfig.username` | empty string |
| `<cluster>.authConfig.password` | empty string |
| `apiConfig.authConfig.enabled` | `false` |
| `apiConfig.authConfig.username` | empty string |
| `apiConfig.authConfig.password` | empty string |
| `communicationConfig.requestTimeout` | `10s` |
| `pollingBehavior.interval` | `10s` |
| `pollingBehavior.restartFailedTasks` | `true` |
| `pollingBehavior.backoff.enabled` | `true` |
| `pollingBehavior.backoff.baseDelay` | `20s` |
| `pollingBehavior.backoff.maxDelay` | `10m` |
| `pollingBehavior.backoff.exponential` | `true` |
| `loggingConfig.level` | `INFO` |

In the cluster file, `<cluster>.host` is a DNS hostname or unbracketed IP address (for example, `kafka-connect`, `127.0.0.1`, or `2001:db8::1`), without a URL scheme, port, path, or whitespace. Invalid host syntax is rejected at startup. `<cluster>.port` is a string containing only decimal digits, between 1 and 65535, such as `"8083"`. In the application file, `loggingConfig.level` accepts Go slog levels such as `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`. Connect requests do not follow redirects; a redirect is treated as an unsuccessful status rather than allowing a restart POST to become a GET or send credentials to another endpoint.

Durations are positive strings with units, such as `250ms`, `10s`, `1.5s`, or `1m30s`. Supported units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, and `h`. Numeric, invalid, nonpositive, or overflowing durations are rejected. The maximum backoff delay must be at least the base delay. The default base delay is `20s`, independently of any configured polling interval.

Each file must contain exactly one YAML mapping document. Unknown keys, duplicate keys, null values, aliases, and YAML merge keys are rejected. An application file or Secret overlay containing `{}` keeps existing values; a cluster base file containing `{}` starts with no clusters. Decoder errors omit raw values to prevent credentials from reaching logs.

### Migration from environment variables

The application no longer reads `RESTARTER_*` environment variables. Move their values into the corresponding YAML fields and mount the file. For example, `RESTARTER_POLL_INTERVAL=30s` becomes `pollingBehavior.interval: 30s`, and Connect credentials become `<cluster>.authConfig.username` and `<cluster>.authConfig.password` in the cluster Secret overlay. Move endpoint settings into a named entry in the cluster file. Remove the old environment entries from the Deployment to avoid misleading configuration.

## Kubernetes

Mount any application and cluster base files from a ConfigMap and their optional overlays from a Secret, using read-only directory mounts. A single ConfigMap can contain both base files, and a single Secret can contain both overlays. Pass the file paths through the corresponding command-line flags. The image entrypoint must launch the application binary. If defaults suffice, omit the corresponding file flags and mounts.

For Kustomize deployments, generate the ConfigMap and Secret from these YAML files and keep generated name hashes enabled. Changes to input files generate a new resource name and update the Deployment's volume reference when applied, triggering replacement of the pod. This makes configuration and credential changes follow the same deployment process. See [Kustomize generators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/).

Use one replica and the `Recreate` strategy to avoid overlapping pollers issuing duplicate restart requests during updates. Updates include a brief polling interruption and reset the application's in-memory restart backoff history.

For Helm deployments, mount the same files and use pod-template checksum annotations for both chart-managed ConfigMaps and Secrets. Independently managed Secret changes also need an explicit pod restart or a deployment controller that triggers one. See [Helm's rollout guidance](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#automatically-roll-deployments).

Configuration is only read at startup. Updating a mounted file does not change the running application's configuration; restart the pod to apply it. Mounting files does not require the application to access the Kubernetes API. See [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) and [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

## Restart backoff

Backoff is tracked separately for each cluster, connector restart, and task restart. Identical connector names in different clusters do not share backoff state. With exponential backoff enabled, the delay after attempt number `n` is `min(base delay × 2^(n−1), maximum delay)`. For example, the default delays begin at 20 seconds, then 40 seconds, 80 seconds, and so on up to 10 minutes. When exponential backoff is disabled, each attempt uses the base delay. Failed connectors are restarted regardless of `pollingBehavior.restartFailedTasks`; that setting controls failed tasks whose connector is running.

Every outbound restart request counts as an attempt, including requests that return errors. A `RUNNING` connector clears its connector backoff, and a `RUNNING` task clears that task's backoff; a future failure then starts again at the base delay. A successful status snapshot also removes backoff entries for connectors and tasks that are no longer present. If status retrieval or decoding fails, no actions, resets, or cleanup happen on that poll.

## Configuration API

API Basic Auth is disabled by default and is independent of Kafka Connect authentication. To enable it, put this in the base configuration:

```yaml
apiConfig:
  authConfig:
    enabled: true
```

Supply credentials in the Secret YAML overlay, not the ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiConfig:
  authConfig:
    username: healer-admin
    password: replace-me
```

Enabled API authentication requires a nonblank username without a colon and a nonempty password; otherwise startup fails. Missing, malformed, or incorrect credentials return `401 Unauthorized` with a Basic Auth challenge before any route handler runs. All routes require the same credentials. Clients can use `curl --user healer-admin https://your-healer-host/config` to be prompted for the password. Credentials are never included in authentication error responses or logs.

API authentication is startup-only: PATCH cannot enable, disable, or change its credentials. Update the startup files and restart to apply those changes. Resubmitting identical API settings is a no-op and is allowed.

Basic Auth does not encrypt credentials. The service still listens using HTTP; use a trusted TLS-terminating ingress/proxy and restrict direct backend access. Protect the proxy-to-service connection as appropriate for your deployment, and do not expose the unauthenticated default API to untrusted networks. See [Go's Basic Auth documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.SetBasicAuth).

`GET /config` returns only the effective application configuration as JSON, omits the API authentication password, and sets `Cache-Control: no-store` to prevent caching. Durations use the same string format as YAML, with Go's canonical spelling (for example, `10m` is written as `10m0s`). Numeric JSON durations are rejected.

`PATCH /config` accepts a partial application JSON object using the same field names and requires `Content-Type: application/json` (parameters such as `charset=utf-8` are accepted). Missing, malformed, or unsupported content types return `415` with `Accept-Patch: application/json`. Supplied fields replace their current values; omitted fields retain them, including an omitted API authentication password. The complete resulting configuration must pass the same validation as startup. Invalid updates return `400` without changing stored values. Field errors identify the affected path without exposing submitted values. Successful updates return `204 No Content` and notify the polling and logging workers. Bodies larger than 64 KiB return `413`; body-read timeouts return `408`.

```sh
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/config \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"pollingBehavior":{"interval":"30s","restartFailedTasks":false}}'
```

JSON handling uses Go's `encoding/json/v2`. Null values and duplicate keys are rejected at every nesting level. Duplicate checking also catches escaped spellings and casing differences such as `interval` and `Interval`. Repeating a key in separate objects is allowed. Unknown fields and invalid UTF-8 are rejected too. Cluster configuration fields are unknown to this endpoint and return `400`. JSON decoding errors use JSON Pointer paths, such as `/pollingBehavior/interval`; configuration validation errors use dotted paths.

Application updates affect only the running process. YAML files are never modified, and restarting restores configuration from those files.

### Cluster management

`GET /clusters` returns a JSON object keyed by cluster name, omits passwords, and sets `Cache-Control: no-store`. An empty collection is returned as `{}`.

`PUT /clusters/{name}` creates or replaces one complete cluster definition; it does not merge with the existing definition or apply YAML defaults. Host and port are required, and enabled authentication requires HTTPS and supplied credentials. Omitted fields become their zero values, including an omitted password; there is no password-preservation behavior. Invalid definitions leave the current poller untouched. PUT requires `Content-Type: application/json` and rejects unknown fields, duplicate keys, null values, invalid UTF-8, and malformed JSON. Bodies larger than 64 KiB return `413`, unsupported content types return `415`, and body-read timeouts return `408`.

Creating a cluster returns `201 Created` with a `Location` header. Replacing a cluster returns `204 No Content`: the old poller is canceled and awaited before its replacement starts with a new client and fresh backoff history. An identical definition returns `204` without replacing the poller or resetting its history. Other clusters are unchanged. Duplicate endpoints produce a warning but are allowed.

```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/clusters/production \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"host":"connect.production.svc","port":"8083","https":false,"authConfig":{"enabled":false}}'
```

`DELETE /clusters/{name}` cancels that cluster's poller, waits for it to exit, and removes its definition before returning `204`. An unknown name returns `404`. Removal stops future polling but cannot undo restart requests already accepted by Kafka Connect. PUT and DELETE return `503` when the application is shutting down. New pollers use the application's lifetime context, so completing an API request does not stop them.

Cluster updates are also in-memory only. Startup YAML files remain untouched, and restarting restores the definitions from those files. API authentication settings remain startup-only.

## License

Copyright 2026 Entropic Works, Inc. See [NOTICE](NOTICE) for attribution.

Kafka Connect Healer is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE).
Third-party dependencies retain their own licenses and notices, which are preserved in `vendor/` and included in the Docker image.

## Vendored dependencies

`vendor/` contains copies of the dependency packages needed to build and test the application; currently this is `go.yaml.in/yaml/v3`. Go automatically uses this directory for ordinary builds and tests when it is present. The Docker build explicitly uses `-mod=vendor`, so compilation does not download dependencies. Vendoring is optional for Go modules, but useful when builds must work without access to a module proxy. It does not reduce the runtime image size; only compiled code is included in the binary.

After changing dependencies in `go.mod`, run `go mod vendor` and commit the updated vendor tree. Do not edit vendored source files directly. See [Go's vendoring documentation](https://go.dev/ref/mod#vendoring).

## Tests

```sh
go test ./...
```

Run the same build, static analysis, and race-enabled tests used by CI:

```sh
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test -race -shuffle=on -count=3 -timeout=5m ./...
```

CI also checks formatting, verifies dependency checksums, runs `govulncheck`, builds
and smoke-tests the Docker image, and renders the Kubernetes example. The smoke test
checks API reads and updates, cluster creation/deletion, authentication, password
redaction, packaged attribution, and clean shutdown with a non-root, read-only
container. It does not test remediation against a real Kafka Connect cluster.
Go is selected from `go.mod`.

Run the additional checks locally:

```sh
go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.8.0 ./...
docker build -t kafka-connect-healer:local .
bash scripts/docker-smoke-test.sh kafka-connect-healer:local
kubectl kustomize examples/kubernetes
```

## Contributing and security

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development and pull request guidance,
and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private vulnerability reporting and deployment
precautions.

## Releases

The release workflow publishes to Docker Hub's `entropicworks/kafka-connect-healer`
repository only after the full CI checks pass for the tagged commit. It builds Linux
amd64 and arm64 images and attaches an SBOM and build provenance. Only the full
version tag is published (`v0.1.0`, or a prerelease such as `v0.1.0-rc.1`); no floating
`latest`, major, or minor tags are updated. The runtime image includes `LICENSE`,
`NOTICE`, and dependency licenses.

Before the first release, maintainers must:

1. Set GitHub Actions repository secret `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` to the Docker account
   used for publishing, and repository secret `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` to an access token
   with write access to the Docker Hub repository. Do not use the account password
   or commit the token. Make the Docker Hub repository public for a public release.
2. Enable GitHub private vulnerability reporting, monitor reports, and protect the
   main branch and release tags so only authorized maintainers can publish.
3. Check the full Git history for secrets and test against a real Kafka Connect
   cluster, including failed connectors/tasks, authentication, backoff, and shutdown.

To release, tag the reviewed commit after committing all release inputs:

```sh
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m 'Kafka Connect Healer v0.1.0'
git push origin v0.1.0
```

After the workflow succeeds, create a GitHub release for the same tag with release
notes, supported Kafka Connect versions that were actually tested, known limitations,
and the Docker image reference/digest. The workflow publishes images only; it does not
create a GitHub release or upload standalone binary archives. Do not move published
version tags; publish a new patch version for fixes. Use an image digest for deployments
that require immutable image references.
